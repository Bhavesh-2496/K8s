There are different ways to set up and run Kubernetes

1) kubectl - The Kubernetes command-line tool, kubectl, allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. You can use kubectl to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs.

2) kind - lets you run Kubernetes on your local computer. This tool requires that you have either Docker or Podman installed.

3) minikube - Like kind, minikube is a tool that lets you run Kubernetes locally. minikube runs an all-in-one or a multi-node local Kubernetes cluster on your personal computer.

4) kubeadm - You can use the kubeadm tool to create and manage Kubernetes clusters. It performs the actions necessary to get a minimum viable, secure cluster up and running in a user friendly way.
