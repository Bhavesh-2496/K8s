# K8s Intro & Overview
-> The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot.
-> K8s as an abbreviation results from counting the eight letters between the "K" and the "s".
-> Google open sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014.

# Why Kubernetes
-> Containers are a good way to bundle and run your applications. In a production environment, you need to manage the containers that run the applications and ensure that there is no           downtime.For example, if a container goes down, another container needs to start. That's how Kubernetes comes to the rescue! 
-> Kubernetes provides you with a framework to run distributed systems resiliently.
-> It takes care of scaling and failover for your application, provides deployment patterns, and more. 

# What Kubernetes provides
-> Service discovery and load balancing
-> Storage orchestration
-> Automated rollouts and rollbacks -  You can describe the desired state for your deployed containers using Kubernetes, and it can change the actual state to the desired state.
-> Automatic bin packing - You tell Kubernetes how much CPU and memory (RAM) each container needs. Kubernetes can fit containers onto your nodes to make the best use of your resources.
-> Self-healing -  Kubernetes restarts containers that fail, replaces containers, kills containers that don't respond to your user.
-> Horizontal scaling
