# Traditional deployment era
👉 Early on, organizations ran applications on physical servers. 
👉 There was no way to define resource boundaries for applications in a physical server, and this caused resource allocation issues. 
👉 For example, if multiple applications run on a physical server, there can be instances where one application would take up most of the resources.
👉 As a result, the other applications would underperform. 
👉 A solution for this would be to run each application on a different physical server. 
👉 this did not scale as resources were underutilized, and it was expensive for organizations to maintain many physical servers.

# Virtualized deployment era
👉 As a solution, virtualization was introduced. 
👉 It allows you to run multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) on a single physical server's CPU. 
👉 Virtualization allows applications to be isolated between VMs and provides a level of security as the information of one application cannot be freely accessed by another application.
👉 Virtualization allows better utilization of resources in a physical server and allows better scalability because an application can be added or updated easily, reduces hardware costs, and much more.
👉 VM runs on top of a hypervisor, which adds an extra layer between hardware and OS provide Slower performance than bare metal.
👉 Each VM includes a full operating system result High RAM consumption, Large disk usage, Slower boot time.
👉 Limited scalability - Spinning up many VMs takes time and consumes infrastructure resources.
👉 Management complexity - Multiple VMs require patching, monitoring, and OS maintenance.
👉 Cost - Licensing (OS + hypervisor), Hardware requirements, Maintenance cost.

# Container deployment era:
-> Virtual Machines and Containers both let you run applications in isolated environments
-> A VM virtualizes hardware. Each VM has Full operating system, Hardware, Apllication. Provide Strong Isolation & Running Application.
-> A Containers virtualize the OS layer. They share the host kernel. Each container includes Application, Dependencies It is Lightweight, Fast startup, High scalability.
